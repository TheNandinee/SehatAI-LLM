TOPIC: Dehydration

Dehydration is a condition that occurs when the body loses more fluids than it takes in, leading to an imbalance that affects normal bodily functions.

Common symptoms of dehydration include thirst, dry mouth, reduced urine output, dark-coloured urine, fatigue, dizziness, and headache.

Severe dehydration may result in confusion, rapid heartbeat, low blood pressure, sunken eyes, and fainting. In extreme cases, it can be life-threatening.

Dehydration is commonly caused by diarrhoea, vomiting, fever, excessive sweating, or insufficient fluid intake.

Treatment focuses on replacing lost fluids and electrolytes. Mild to moderate dehydration is managed with oral rehydration solutions, while severe cases may require intravenous fluids.

Prevention includes adequate fluid intake, especially during illness, high temperatures, or physical activity.
