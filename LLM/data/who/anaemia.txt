TOPIC: Anaemia

Anaemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells or the concentration of haemoglobin is insufficient to meet the body's physiological needs.

Common symptoms include fatigue, weakness, dizziness, shortness of breath, pale skin, and reduced physical performance.

Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anaemia, though it can also result from infections, chronic diseases, nutritional deficiencies, or inherited conditions.

Anaemia is particularly prevalent among women of reproductive age, children, and pregnant individuals.

Diagnosis is typically made through blood tests measuring haemoglobin levels.

Prevention and treatment depend on the underlying cause and may include dietary improvements, iron supplementation, treatment of infections, or medical care for chronic conditions.
