TOPIC: Diabetes

Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease characterized by elevated levels of blood glucose resulting from insufficient insulin production or ineffective use of insulin by the body.

Common symptoms include frequent urination, excessive thirst, increased hunger, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, and blurred vision.

If left unmanaged, diabetes can lead to serious complications such as heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, nerve damage, vision loss, and lower-limb amputation.

Type 2 diabetes is the most common form and is strongly associated with lifestyle factors such as unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, and excess body weight.

Management of diabetes includes healthy eating, regular physical activity, blood glucose monitoring, and the use of medications such as insulin or oral glucose-lowering drugs.

Early diagnosis and proper management can prevent or delay complications.
