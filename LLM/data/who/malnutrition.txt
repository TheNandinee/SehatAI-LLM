TOPIC: Malnutrition

Malnutrition refers to deficiencies, excesses, or imbalances in a person’s intake of energy and nutrients.

It includes undernutrition (wasting, stunting, underweight), micronutrient deficiencies, and overweight or obesity.

Symptoms of undernutrition include low body weight, weakened immunity, delayed growth in children, fatigue, and increased susceptibility to infections.

Malnutrition is caused by inadequate dietary intake, disease, poor maternal nutrition, and socio-economic factors.

Malnutrition has serious long-term consequences for health, cognitive development, and productivity.

Prevention involves ensuring access to nutritious food, promoting healthy diets, improving maternal and child care, and addressing underlying social and economic determinants.
