TOPIC: Hypertension

Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is a condition in which the force of blood against artery walls is persistently too high.

Hypertension often has no noticeable symptoms, which is why it is commonly referred to as a "silent killer."

When symptoms occur, they may include headaches, dizziness, shortness of breath, chest pain, or visual disturbances, though these are not specific.

Uncontrolled hypertension increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, kidney damage, and other serious health problems.

Risk factors include high salt intake, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use, excessive alcohol consumption, obesity, and stress.

Prevention and management involve lifestyle modifications such as reducing salt intake, maintaining a healthy diet, regular physical activity, and medication when prescribed.
