TOPIC: Anemia

Anemia is a condition in which the blood lacks enough healthy red blood cells or hemoglobin to carry adequate oxygen to body tissues.

Symptoms commonly include fatigue, weakness, dizziness, shortness of breath, pale skin, and reduced ability to concentrate.

Iron-deficiency anemia is the most common type and may result from inadequate dietary intake, blood loss, or increased iron needs during pregnancy.

Certain populations, including young children, pregnant individuals, and people with chronic diseases, are at higher risk.

Diagnosis is typically made through blood tests measuring hemoglobin and iron levels.

Treatment depends on the cause and may include dietary changes, iron supplementation, or medical treatment of underlying conditions.
