TOPIC: Dehydration

Dehydration occurs when the body does not have enough fluids to function properly due to fluid loss exceeding intake.

Common signs and symptoms include thirst, dry mouth, decreased urination, dark-colored urine, fatigue, dizziness, and headache.

Severe dehydration may lead to confusion, rapid heart rate, low blood pressure, sunken eyes, and fainting. In infants and children, symptoms may include dry diapers, lack of tears, and lethargy.

Dehydration can result from illnesses causing vomiting or diarrhea, excessive sweating, fever, or inadequate fluid intake.

Treatment depends on severity and includes drinking fluids, oral rehydration solutions, or intravenous fluids in severe cases.

Preventive measures include regular fluid intake, especially during hot weather, illness, or physical exertion.
