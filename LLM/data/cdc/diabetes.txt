Diabetes is a chronic condition in which blood glucose levels are too high due to insufficient insulin production or ineffective use of insulin.

Common symptoms include increased thirst, frequent urination, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, blurred vision, and slow healing of wounds.

Type 2 diabetes is the most common form and is associated with factors such as excess body weight, physical inactivity, family history, and age.

If not well controlled, diabetes can lead to complications including heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, nerve damage, vision loss, and foot problems.

Management includes healthy eating, regular physical activity, blood glucose monitoring, and medications such as insulin or oral drugs when prescribed.

Early detection and long-term management reduce the risk of complications.
