TOPIC: Malnutrition

Malnutrition refers to inadequate, excessive, or imbalanced intake of nutrients that affects body composition and health.

Undernutrition can lead to low body weight, weakened immunity, delayed growth, fatigue, and increased risk of infections.

Malnutrition may result from insufficient food intake, poor diet quality, chronic illness, digestive disorders, or socio-economic factors.

Children, older adults, and individuals with chronic medical conditions are particularly vulnerable.

Consequences of malnutrition include impaired physical and cognitive development, reduced productivity, and increased disease risk.

Prevention involves access to adequate nutrition, balanced diets, healthcare support, and addressing underlying social and health factors.
