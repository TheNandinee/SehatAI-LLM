TOPIC: Hypertension

Hypertension, or high blood pressure, occurs when the force of blood against the artery walls remains elevated over time.

Most people with hypertension do not experience symptoms, making regular blood pressure measurement essential for diagnosis.

Uncontrolled high blood pressure increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, and other serious health problems.

Risk factors include high sodium intake, low physical activity, obesity, excessive alcohol consumption, smoking, stress, and genetic factors.

Management strategies include reducing salt intake, maintaining a healthy diet, regular physical activity, limiting alcohol, and taking prescribed medications.

Lifestyle changes combined with medical treatment help control blood pressure and reduce health risks.
